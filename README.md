Online Examination System
This Online Examination System is a web-based application designed to simulate a real-time quiz environment. 
The application features a series of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that users can navigate through using 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons.
Each question has four possible answers, and users can select their answer using radio buttons. 
The system includes a timer set for 15 minutes, displayed prominently at the top of the page, which counts down from 15 minutes to zero.
When the timer runs out, the exam automatically finishes, and the user's score is displayed. Users can also manually finish the exam at any time by clicking the 'Finish' button.
The interface is user-friendly and provides immediate feedback on each answer selection, helping users assess their performance in real-time.
This program is ideal for educational purposes, mock tests, and self-assessment quizzes.
